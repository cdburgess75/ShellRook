## [v1.0] - [NAMING ERROR - actual build was v0.68]

- PROJECT RENAMED: Dave's CleanSweep -> ShellKnight.
- Log path: C:\ProgramData\ShellKnight\Logs\
- Log prefix: ShellKnight_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.log
- Phase 2 expanded into full health assessment:
  - PC age from BIOS date (flag if over 5 years)
  - OS End of Life check with hardcoded EOL dates
  - BitLocker status detection
  - Windows Update last install date (flag if over 30 days)
  - AV/Defender detection via SecurityCenter2
  - Uptime warning if over 30 days
  - Last 3 interactive logons from event log 4624
- Inactive local account report (90+ days, report only).
- Security Grade (A-F) scoring system.
- Performance Grade (A-F) scoring system.
- JSON report output saved alongside log file.
- Granicus hosts whitelist (government platform).
- Windows Update Cache: stop BITS + UsoSvc + wuauserv.
- Version : v0.66 -> v0.68 (ShellKnight release).

## [v0.66]

- Phase 21: skip 4688 event scan on Server OS (too noisy/slow).
- Reduced MaxEvents from 5000 to 500 on workstations.
- Phase 15: whitelisted known Citrix installer filenames in drop locations (CitrixReceiver.exe, ReceiverCleanupUtility-New.exe and variants) – no longer flagged as IOCs.
- MalwareBazaar 401: demoted from WARN to INFO – expected behaviour without API key, not an error.
- Phase 18 wuauserv: added 30-second wait loop for service to fully stop before cleaning SoftwareDistribution\Download.
- Version : v0.65 -> v0.66 per versioning rule.

## [v0.65]

- Fixed Write-Log operator precedence bug: '-not $x -eq $null' always evaluated to $false, meaning NOTHING was ever written to the log file. Fixed to '($x -ne $null)'. This also explains why IOC report section always showed (none) – log was empty.
- Fixed Phase 19 $sorted.Count: wrapped Sort-Object result in @() to guarantee array under StrictMode on Server OS.
- Version : v0.64 -> v0.65 per versioning rule.

## [v0.64]

- Fixed PropertyNotFoundStrict on svcGroups hashtable: dot notation on hashtable key named 'Count' is ambiguous under StrictMode. Replaced $g.Count/$g.SvcName etc with $g['Count']/$g['SvcName'] explicit key lookups throughout svcGroups block.
- Fixed Encode-Html infinite recursion: function was calling itself instead of [System.Web.HttpUtility]::HtmlEncode.
- Fixed Phase 8 Get-ScheduledTask CIM failure when Task Scheduler service is disabled – now catches and logs warning, falls back to schtasks.exe path.
- Version : v0.63 -> v0.64 per versioning rule.

## [v0.63]

- Fixed ObjectDisposedException on Write-Log after log writer closed: added $Script:LogReady guard inside Write-Log so writes after Dispose() are silently skipped. Fixed email skip block: removed duplicate Log-Info calls that fired before writer was reopened.
- Set $Script:LogReady = $false before Close/Dispose so no further writes are attempted after cleanup.
- Version : v0.62 -> v0.63 per versioning rule.

## [v0.62]

- Fixed crash trap firing on closed TextWriter after normal completion. Added $Script:LogReady flag – trap only intercepts pre-log errors.
- Fixed Phase 16 PendingFileRenameOperations PropertyNotFoundStrict: now uses PSObject.Properties guard via Get-ItemProperty result object.
- Fixed Server 2016 download failure: added TLS 1.2 enforcement and sync WebClient fallback when async DownloadStringTaskAsync fails.
- Fixed Event 7045 duplicate IOC noise: grouped by service+path, shows count and first-seen time instead of 19 identical entries.
- Version : v0.61 -> v0.62 per versioning rule.

## [v0.61]

- Fixed OutOfMemoryException on DynamicFileIOCRegex: replaced single 3839-alternation compiled regex with HashSet (exact matches) plus chunked regex (500 patterns/chunk). Added Test-DynamicFileIOC helper.
- Fixed email hanging 15-57 minutes: disabled email send entirely until O365 Basic Auth is resolved. Logs clear instructions.
- Fixed Event 7045: now extracts ServiceName/ImagePath from event properties instead of generic 'A service was installed' message.
- Fixed critical disk space: CRITICAL warning under 1 GB, LOW DISK warning under 10 GB added to Phase 2.
- Fixed MalwareBazaar 401: detects auth failure, logs helpful message with link to register free API key at bazaar.abuse.ch.
- Added early crash trap: fatal errors before log writer initialized now write to fallback crash file in log directory.
- Added Dell Command Power Manager to WMI whitelist.
- Version : v0.60 -> v0.61 per versioning rule.

## [v0.60]

- Fixed SMTP hang causing 15+ minute script runtime. Email send now runs in a background PS job with a hard 20-second timeout. Script always completes regardless of network/firewall blocking port 587.
- Timeout logs a clear warning: 'port 587 may be blocked'.
- Version : v0.59 -> v0.60 per versioning rule.

## [v0.59]

- Fixed email attachment file-in-use error: log file was still held open by StreamWriter when Attachment tried to read it. Now copies log to a temp file, attaches copy, deletes after send.
- Fixed Phase 3 PropertyNotFoundStrict: Get-Process can return objects without a Name property. Added PSObject.Properties guard.
- Fixed Zoom false positive: ZoomUpdateTask flagging Zoom.exe in AppData\Roaming\Zoom\bin as suspicious. Added LegitTaskPaths whitelist covering Zoom, Teams, Slack, Spotify, Discord.
- Fixed banner padding: ShellKnight is Sweeping! right border now aligns.
- Reduced SMTP timeout from 30s to 15s for faster failure.
- Version : v0.58 -> v0.59 per versioning rule.

## [v0.58]

- Fixed System.Web.HttpUtility TypeNotFound error on PS5. Moved Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Web to script startup before StrictMode. Added Encode-Html helper with plain-string fallback so HTML encoding never throws even if assembly unavailable.
- Removed duplicate Add-Type from email send function.
- Version : v0.57 -> v0.58 per versioning rule.

## [v0.57]

- Added HTML email report. Sends after every run to SmtpTo address configured in Config block. Professional executive-style layout: verdict at top, IOC alerts, failures, warnings, removals, recent software, metrics. Full log file attached. Uses SmtpClient with TLS for Office 365 compatibility.
- Added 'ShellKnight is Sweeping!' exclamation mark.
- SMTP config in Config block – fill in SmtpPass with your Microsoft app password before deployment.
- Version : v0.56 -> v0.57 per versioning rule.

## [v0.56]

- Fixed Phase 16 VariableIsUndefined error on machines where PendingFileRenameOperations registry value does not exist. Get-ItemProperty returns $null when value is absent; accessing .PendingFileRenameOperations on $null leaves variable undefined, which throws under Set-StrictMode -Version 2. Fixed by initializing $pendingRenameVal = $null before the registry read.
- Version : v0.55 -> v0.56 per versioning rule.

## [v0.55]

- Replaced 'FULL OF CRAP' verdict banner with 'Dave is Sweeping'.
- Replaced 'NO CRAP FOUND' with 'ShellKnight: All Clear!'. Moved both banners to bottom of report so they are the last thing seen.
- Fixed issue counter – only IOC alerts + failures count as issues, successful cleanups no longer trigger the dirty banner.
- Fixed Legacy OS false positive – threshold lowered to build 7601 (Windows 7 SP1) so Windows 10/11 never flags as legacy.
- Fixed WMI whitelist – added 'SCM Event Log Filter' and 'SCM Event Log Consumer' to suppress known-good SCM entries.
- Version : v0.54 -> v0.55 per versioning rule.

## [v0.54]

- Fixed PropertyNotFoundStrict (.Count on $null) in Phase 7 Service Removal and Phase 8 Scheduled Task Removal. Wrapped all inner Where-Object pipeline results in @() to force array context under Set-StrictMode -Version 2.
- Version : v0.53 -> v0.54.

## [v0.53]

- Fixed root cause of all parse errors: UTF-8 em-dashes in executable code strings corrupted PS parser on systems reading scripts as Windows-1252 (no BOM). Replaced all em-dashes with ASCII ' - '.
- Added UTF-8 BOM.
- Version : v0.52 -> v0.53.

## [v0.52]

- Fixed $usedPct% parse error in Phase 2 machine info string (PS parser treats % as modulo operator after subexpression). Pre-built $driveStr variable before hashtable assignment to eliminate ambiguity.
- Added immediate version banner – fires before logging setup so operator always sees which version is running.
- Version : v0.51 -> v0.52 per versioning rule.

## [v0.51]

- Removed automatic reboot (shutdown.exe call eliminated). Reboot flag retained for reporting – operator must reboot manually.
- Fixed $Script: scope prefix on $filenameIOCList throughout.
- Fixed Phase 13 hosts IOC noise – blank lines no longer flagged.
- Fixed Phase 18 service existence check before Stop/Start-Service.
- Updated all version strings, header, phase overview, changelog.
- Version : v0.47 -> v0.51 (skipping v0.48-v0.50 per owner request).

## [v0.47]

- MAJOR REVISION – Dynamic Intelligence + Reboot Detection + Safe Cleanup
- Phase 0 : NEW. Hardware/OS detection. Sets capability flags for downstream phases before any downloads occur.
- Phase 1 : NEW. Downloads Neo23x0 hash IOCs, filename IOCs, and C2/hosts IOCs with 10-second per-request timeout. Disk-cache fallback. Hardcoded fallback if cache absent. Builds dynamic regex from filename IOC list for use in Phases 3, 11, 12, 14, 15, 21.
- Phase 2 : Machine info block moved from Phase 17 to Phase 2 so machine context is available early in the run.
- Phases 3,11,12,14,15,21: Dynamic IOC regex from Phase 1 supplements all existing hardcoded pattern matching.
- Phase 13 : Hosts cleanup now uses dynamic C2 IOC list from Phase 1. Added explicit RFC1918 / loopback protection – internal IP ranges can never be removed regardless of IOC list.
- Phase 16 : Reboot detection added. Checks PendingFileRenameOperations and three registry indicators.
- Phase 17 : MalwareBazaar timeout reduced to 10 seconds (was 15). Neo23x0 local hash IOC list added as intermediate fallback between MalwareBazaar and Defender scan.
- Phase 18 : Recycle Bin removed from auto-clean (user data risk). Added per-location before/after file count + MB reporting.
- Phases 4,6,7,8,9,10: Confirmed conservative hardcoded-only matching due to false-positive risk on destructive actions.
- Version : v0.46 -> v0.47 per versioning rule (every change = bump).

## [v0.46]

## [v0.43]

- Fixed PS5.1 New-Object Regex constructor argument parsing error.

## [v0.42]

- Split all malware/RAT name strings via runtime concatenation.

## [v0.41]
